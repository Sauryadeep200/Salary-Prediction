## Overview

This project focuses on predicting salaries using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the provided dataset, the model learns patterns and relationships between features to make accurate salary predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Salary.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of experience
- `Salary`: Corresponding salary

## Model

The model implemented in this project is a simple linear regression model. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Usage

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sauryadeep200/ml-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ml-project
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the main script**:

   Execute the `main.py` script to train the model and make predictions:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
